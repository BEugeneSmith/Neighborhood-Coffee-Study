Neighborhood Coffee Study
=====

I'm interested in trying as many indie/not-Starbucks coffee places in Chicago, but I don't always have the time and patience to make it out to them. Is there some way to score them such that I can visit a few over the weekend over the course of a few hours?

The most updated notebook can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BEugeneSmith/Neighborhood-Coffee-Study/blob/master/working/coffee/Chicago_presentation_notebook_07082017.ipynb), but feel free to explore the repo.  
  
Thanks,  
Eugene
