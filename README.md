Neighborhood Coffee Study
=====

I'm interested in trying as many indie/not-Starbucks coffee places in Chicago, but I don't always have the time and patience to make it out to them. Is there some way to score them such that I can visit a few over the weekend over the course of a few hours.

Thanks,  
Eugene
