Neighborhood Coffee Study
=====

I'm interested in trying as many indie/not-Starbucks coffee places in Chicago, but I don't always have the time and patience to make it out to them. Is there some way to score them such that I can visit a few over the weekend over the course of a few hours. The most up to date notebook is (here)[https://github.com/BEugeneSmith/Neighborhood-Coffee-Study/blob/master/working/coffee/NeighborhoodCoffeeStudy_upd082317.ipynb].

Thanks,  
Eugene
